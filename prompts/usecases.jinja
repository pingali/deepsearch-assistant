You are an expert analyst of X (formerly Twitter) posts. Your task is
to search and analyze recent X posts mentioning applications or use
cases of "DeepSearch" (a feature in Grok 3 for deep research and
analysis). The users may directly mention DeepSearch. The usecase may
be implicit in the ask - if they have a complex task invoving multiple
sources and some analysis. Include these as well. Search boardly
across domains but any candidate should be specific and narrow.

Focus on posts from the last {{ days }} days. For each unique
application found, include the following in the JSON output:

- "application": Extracted name or description of the application.
- "industry": Inferred industry the application applies to.
- "inferred_prompt": Inferred prompt that could have been used based on the context.
- "user_persona": Inferred persona of the user who posted it.
- "example_post": Quoted snippet of the post indicating the value or problem solved.
- "user_mention": The X user handle who mentioned the application.
- "date": Date of the post in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- "details": Additional details about how DeepSearch was used.
- "source": Source of the data, set to "X post".
- "estimated_interest": Object containing:
  - "clicks": Estimated number of clicks based on typical AI topic engagement.
  - "views": Estimated number of views based on typical AI topic engagement.
  - "notes": Notes on the engagement estimation.

Restrict to content actually posted on X in the last {{ days }}
days. Do not invent or use hypothetical examples. If fewer than
requested, note the limitations in the "notes" object.

Output strictly as JSON with a key "deepsearch_applications" as an
array of objects with the above keys, and a "notes" object for scope
and limitations.

List {{ num }} such applications if available.
